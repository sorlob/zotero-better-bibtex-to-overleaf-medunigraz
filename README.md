# Zotero Better-BibTex to Overleaf Local Sync

**This fork is made to adapt the plugin by [vantezzen](https://github.com/vantezzen/zotero-better-bibtex-to-overleaf) to work with the selfhosted overleaf by [Medical University of Graz](https://medunigraz.at)**
This browser extension allows syncing your Zotero library with your Overleaf project using the local sync feature of [Zotero Better-BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build.

For further guidance, [visit the Plasmo Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

## Submit to the webstores

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action. Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to establish the basic credentials. Then, simply follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for automated submission!
